# Decision Tree #
- you want a short tree (rather than a tall tree)
    - allows you to run through the tree faster

## Gini impurity ##
- function:
    - $G_i = 1 - \sum[p_(i,k)^2]$
- the more spread out it is, the more impure it is

## CART cost function ##
- $J(k, t_k) = M_l/mMG_l) + M_r/M(G_r)$
    - where l = leftside, r = rightside

## Where to Stop ##
- Definitely stop when impurity cannot be reduced
- Hyperparameters such as max depth, min samples per leaf
- Stop if improvement is not statistically significant
