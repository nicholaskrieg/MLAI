# Machine Learning Landscape #
- Supervised learning
    - in: examples (features)
    - out: classification
    - regression
- Unsupervised learning
    - given examples as input 
        - no labels or correct examples
    - clustering algorithm 
    - dimensionality reduction
        - if i have 10 dimensional data, you want to reduce that to two dimensions 
            - look at most important dimsensions that capture variability
            - could be combination of dimensions
    - anomaly detection
    - association rule learning
- reinforcement learning
    - similar to supervised
        - reinforce correct answers
    - monte carlo tree search type of reinforcement learning
- semi-supervised
    - you have a bunch of exmaple with correct labels for some of them
        - can imply correct labels for unknowns

## Train Your Model ##
- Online 
    - feed examples one at a time
    - update model incrementally as you go
- Batch

## Type Of Model ##
- Instance based 
    - nearest neighbor model
        - k nearest neigbor
- model based
    - formula that will encapsulate what you learn about training instances
    - dont need to keep training data 
    - cost function
        - adjust model to minimize cost

## Overfitting ##
- model does great on training data but not great on new data
- need to test model to see if its overfitting
- overfitting runs into generalizable problems
- when a model memorizes the training data, it overfits and is not generalizable
- overfitting solutions:
    - use more simple model
        - fewer degrees of freedom (fewer numbers in the model that are allowed to change)
        - regularize: put penality on overly fancy model
    - get more data

## Underfitting ##
- model doesn't do well on training data
- need to test model to see if its underfitting
- underfitting solution:
    - use more complex model
    - get better input features
        - example: add x^2 to input feature

## Data Snooping ##
- happens when you look at testing data before you complete the model
- use a validation set for testing
    - this ensures that you havent seen the test dataset before you run final tests
