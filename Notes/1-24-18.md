# Notes for 1-24-18

## PyCrust

- The user can say `while x` because as long as the value isnt 0 it is true. Because of truthyness
- `break` and `continue` work the same as they do in java.

- this program will break as x equals 2

## For Loops

- Iterables:
    - Sequence
        - String
        - List
        - Tuple
    - Set
    - Dictionary
- `zip` is used when you want to iterate over two lists in parallel


## List Comprehension
- assume you want the squares of each number in a range from 1 to 11
    - `[n ** 2 for n in range(1,11)]`
- If you want all the odds
    - `[n ** 2 for n in range(1,11) if n % 2 == 1]`
- These lists can be nested
    - `[(a,b) for a in range(3) for b in 'word']`
- Dictionary comprehensions are also possible!
    - `{a:a**2 for a in range(3)}`
- The way enumerate works is that you get a key and a value so the form would be: 
    - `for i,x in enumerate('test')`
    - Where `i` is the key and `x` is the value 

## Functions
- Functions are defined with the `def` keyword followed by the arguments and then a "`:`":
```Python
def hello(string_to_print):
    print(string)
```
- For this example we define a function that takes a string and prints it out
- Types dont need to specified in the argument list as types are dynamic 
- Below is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number

```Python
def factorial(n):
    if n==0:
        return 1
    return factorial(n-1) * n
```
- ***Python is call by value NOT call by reference***
- Arguments can be defined with default values and can be overwritten if a second aregument is passed in its place 
```Python
def leppard(band, verb = 'rocks'):
    print(band + '' + verb)
```
- Passing a second argument will override the `verb` but if a second arg isn't passed it will use `rocks` instead
- Arguments can be passed and they will be treated as a list with the following function
```Python
def f(*args):
    print(args)
```
- It will take all arguments that are passed and create a list of them
- Similarly can be done with a dictionary
```Python 
def f(**kwargs):
    print(args)
```
- This will take all arguments and create a dictionary of the args
- Functions can be nested inside each other like the following example
```Python
def compose(a,b):
    def result(n):
        return a(b(n))
    return result
```
- Lambda functions can be created as follows
- To generalize, a lambda function is a function that takes any number of arguments (including optional arguments) and returns the value of a single expression. lambda functions can not contain commands, and they can not contain more than one expression. Don't try to squeeze too much into a lambda function; if you need something more complex, define a normal function instead and make it as long as you want. 
```Python
h = compose(lambda x : x * 10, lambda x : x - 3)
```

## Doc Strings

- Doc strings are used as documnetation in python
- These doc strings go after the first line of signature
```Python
def factorial(n):
"""
This function takes a number and 
returns the factorial with a 
recursive solution
"""
    if n==0:
        return 1
    return factorial(n-1) * n
```
- Above is an example of a proper docstring



## **Code For The Day**

```Python
x = 5
while x:
    print(x)
    x -=1

x = 5
while True:
    print("before")
    if x == 2:
        break
    print("after")
    x -= 1

for n in [1,2,3,4]:
    print(n)

nums = [1,2,3,4]
letters = ['a', 'b','c','d']

zip(nums, letters)

list(zip(nums, letters))

for n, x in zip(nums,letters):
    print(str(n) + x)

for i in range(10):
    print(i)


for i in range(5, 10):
    print(i)

list(enumerate('hello'))

for i, x in enumerate('hello'):
    print(str(i) + x)

list(zip('hello', 'farms', 'paste'))

list(enumerate({1,2,3}))

[n ** 2 for n in range(1,11)]

[n ** 2 for n in range(1,11) if n % 2 == 1]

[(a,b) for a in range(3) for b in 'word']

{a:a**2 for a in range(3)}

{i:x for i, x in enumerate('abcd')}

gen = (x**2 for x in range(10))

for x in gen:
    print(n)

def factorial(n):
    if n==0:
        return 1
    return factorial(n-1) * n

def leppard(band, verb = 'rocks'):
    print(band + '' + verb)
```
